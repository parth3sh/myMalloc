/*
To-Do:
1. Make random calls to mymalloc, myrealloc, and myfree (1 mil)
2. Time how long it takes to finish making all calls
3. Use utilization()
4. mycleanup()

- For number 1, how to choose between mymalloc, myrealloc, and myfree?
	- Assign 0 to mymalloc, 1 to myrealloc, and 2 to myfree
	- Pick random number in interval [0,2]

- For timing, get time before starting test for one fit, time after, and subtract
- Throughput = num ops / time
